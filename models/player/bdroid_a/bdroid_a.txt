Known bugs:
The joints at the top of the legs could do with modifying,
The "fire 2 handed" animation is terrible, but I don't think it is used in the game anyway.

Description:
These are my first ever half life models based on the robots in 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace' (Copyright Lucasfilm Ltd, used without permission). The model has a fairly high polygon count due to the rigid joints.

Installation:

Model Files:    Put Bdroid_a.mdl and Bdroid_a.bmp int valve/models/player/Bdroid_a.

Extras:

Team Logo:      Put Bdroid_a_logo.bmp in your logos directory.
Windows Cursor: Put Bdroid_wait.ani in your windows/cursors directory and set it up as the wait cursor (instead of the arrow & hourglass ).

Distribution:
Distribute these models freely - as a set or individually, but please include the text files.
