Description             : Model of Mario64 Cannon_Guy Created for DocRock for Half-Life

Additional Credits to   : Docrock and BabyKitKat for being so patient with me
=============================================================================

This is a totally custom model for DocRock, originally a little dancing monster
now a full-fledged player model to be distributed with Mario_Killbox.

This model was created totally from scratch other than the skeleton
and animations that were converted and scaled from a variety of different
Half-Life models.

The textures were gathered from many sources, but the best one came from
DocRock and BabyKitKat, thanks you two!

All model work was done in Milkshape 1.6.6.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2,
Wally, Photostyler, mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that
let me do what I needed.

I created the entire mesh in one session, about 1 hour
total time.  The animations took another hour and there was
about an hour checking all the animations (LOL, you should have seen
what it looked like at Cucamonga Chunk O'Phlem with 8 or 10 Cannon_Guys
all fragging each other like mad!).

This model is a little over 1/2 scale in height but is a little wider
than a normal model, quite visable, very funny.

To preserve the "roundness" of the model the weapons emerge from the
little guy's forehead (I mean after all the little guy has NO ARMS!).

This model has the following statistics:
Verticies: 292
Triangles: 544
   Groups: 6
Materials: 1
   Joints: 22

All in all, not bad!
