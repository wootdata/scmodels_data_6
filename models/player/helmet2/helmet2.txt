Description:
This model's based on a drawing I did when I was being bored out of my mind on the beach from my latest holiday. I guess the visor is based off the shape of one of those out of Planetside (dunno which armour), and the rib/layer armour on the belly is inspired from the HEV mark 5 (from HL2). I decided to turn this from paper to model because I wanted to test how well I could actually do the job.

The drawing was originally aimed for just a military-grade HEV (I even planned to have the star symbol that the US army in Half-Life uses, in the place of the lambda symbol), but I guess it works for all groups...
