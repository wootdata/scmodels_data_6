SPECIAL THANKS:

  - All who participated in naming this boy: Pharoah, Daniel,
    Scarecrow and WipEout.
  - Spider and Scarecrow modelling tutorials.
  - COLDFUSION Reviews.


MESH:
 
  737 Tris, 421 Vertrices.
  - Phew... At last, I can do this! The model with low polycount!
    But he is really common.................  :(


SKIN:
  
  1x256x256 texturew with team color capability generated by my TCG 0.70.
  - When his legs deform the skin doesn't look continuous.
    It's obvious that wrap around skin is the best... (too late) 


ANIMATIONS:
 
  - Custom Biped + 2x3 Ponytails  
  - All animations were recreated. Mostly based on valve's. With the
    help of character  studio layer, I'm able to modify valve's easier.
  - Like Hibari, Some crouch aim/shoot animations uses the same aim/shoot 
    while standing ones.
  - I become a bit more busy since Hibari model is reviewed and 
    made public so I didn't have much free time to do animations.
    His bandana fly lifelessly, compare to Tsugumi hair which is
    much better.

  NEW ANIMATIONS
     - 3 new deadposes, not very well animated, though.
     - Longjump
     - Glock/Hornet/Python/Gauss
     - RPG
     - Crowbar


HITBOXES:

  - I use valve standard hitbox and make the head hitbox a little wider
    to compensate for his thin figure.
