So yea...I think you get the point. I did this
all froms scratch and it was all done by yours truely.

---------------------------------
Installation:

Ok, here is the fun part. There are two options in this
release. You can either use the normal KH2 style Sora
model with the single keyblade and single slashing ani-
mations or use the duel wielding (two keyblades) Valor
form Sora model with a seperate set of katana animations.
To use the Normal form just drag and drop the folder named
"Sora" into the players folder in the TS models directory.

("C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\*YOURSTEAMID*\half-life\ts\models\player")

Then drag and drop the files in the folder named "Keyblade"
directly to the models folder. If you plan on switching back
to the standard katana make sure you back it up somewhere.

Now, the second option is to use the new "valor" form inwhich
Sora has a red outfit with some cool designs and wields two
keyblades instead of one.

To use this option simply drag and drop the folder named
"Sora_Valor" into the players folder, then drag and drop
the files from the folder named "Duel_Keyblades" directly
into the models folder, and again, make sure to back up your
old katana model files just incase you want to switch back to
them.

Once ingame, just click "customize" from the TS main menu,
then a box will appear and in the multiplayer tab, click the
player model drop-down box and choose either "Sora" or
"Sora_Valor". Then click apply and you can now play as Sora.

---------------------------------
Editing:

I do not care at all if you edit any of my models, but if
you do edit them and plan to release your edit, then please
make sure you give me proper credit for my work, I put too
much work into these projects for someone to come along,
grab my model, edit it and release it somewhere else claiming
its theirs.
---------------------------------
Well, thanks for downloading my model, I hope you enjoy it.
