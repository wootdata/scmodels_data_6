INSALLATION FOR COUNTER-STRIKE

Download the pak explorer and replace any .mdl you would like to replace with Destro.
Or if you have downloaded a more recent download of CS you can just go into the folders with the mdl's.
You will then see Destro  in the  game instead of the swats/terrorist u replaced. I suggest you
replace the terror.mdl with Destro.mdl
Hope you enjoy it. Make sure to rename the model so it works.



INSTALLATION FOR HLDM

Create a "destro" or/and  a "destro" folder in this location:  C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\valve\models\player
And extract the destro.mdl to the same named folder.
You will not see his picture when you go to select her form the HL options. However once you are in a mutiplayer game, just type this in the console and you'll be all set:   model destro
Booyaa, ur got yourself a HLDM destro now ;)
